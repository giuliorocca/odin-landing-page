                    <p>A special department that deals with the research and development of biological and viral weapons. One of its primary goals is to obtain a viable specimen of the species Xenomorph XX121, whether it be in the form of a Facehugger, a Chestburster, or a mature adult.</p>

                    <p>Run with little regard for morals, although owing to the research being based primarily on the study of appropriated technology, the scope for appalling breaches of human rights is less open. Even so, the division ruthlessly captures and exploits alien tech, stealing Predator and Engineer technology with little thought as to how the species that created it may react.</p>
